This is a simple shell project created by Samuel Chigozie [nzekwesammy@gmail.com] and Michael Kazembe [Michaelkazembe@gmail.com] 
as part of the curriculum for ALX SIMPLE_SHELL TASK.

It is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by running commands. 
The simple shell supports executing external commands, redirecting input and output, pipelining commands,
running commands in the background, environment variable expansion, signal handling, and builtin commands 
such as cd, echo, exit, and more.
